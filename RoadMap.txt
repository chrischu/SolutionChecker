Soon:
* More solution & project rules
** NuGet references should have correct hint path
** (non-dev) NuGet references should have Private set
* Test setup/rules for PersonRegister
** Generated files below Declaration (RN-specific)
** Generated files should be newer than Declaration change date (RN-specific)
** Should have nuspec (RN-specific)
** Project name/default namespace (RN-specific?)
* More tests for object model

Eventually:
* File rules (maybe would be better to write R# inspections)
** Two different ways to check:
*** String-based (just get file source code as string)
*** Roslyn-based (validate source code via Roslyn Syntax Tree)
* GUI Reporting
* Fixes (Console & GUI)
** Enables immediately fixing a problem reported by a rule (not for all rules though)
* GUI for configuring rules
